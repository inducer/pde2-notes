  <section|Introduction>

  Let the points of <with|mode|math|n>-dimensional space be designated by
  <with|mode|math|x>, let <with|mode|math|x<rsub|1>,x<rsub|2>,\<ldots\>,x<rsub|n>>
  be the coordiantes in a fixed cartesian coordinatesystem. Further, let
  <with|mode|math|\<mathd\>x=\<mathd\>x<rsub|1>\<mathd\>x<rsub|2>\<cdots\>\<mathd\>x<rsub|n>>
  be the volume element in <with|mode|math|x>-space. Let
  <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> be a time-dependent vector field defined on an open
  subset <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> of <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-space
  with components <with|mode|math|u<rsub|i>> in the aforementioned coordinate
  system. We will not assume that <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> is connected,
  and only for brevity will be speaking of <with|color|red|regions>. Regions
  in <with|mode|math|x>-space will be denoted <with|mode|math|G>, in
  <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-space they will be denoted
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. The fact that a vector field
  <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> which is continuously
  <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable on an
  <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> is
  divergence-free is characterized by the differential equation

  <\equation>
    div u=<frac|\<partial\>u|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<nu\>>>=0,
  </equation>

  where we note that throughout this paper we will be using the common
  summation convention without the use of the sum symbol. There is also
  another well-known differential-less characterization of the fact that the
  divergence is zero. We say that a scalar or vector-valued function
  <with|mode|math|v(x,t)> on <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> belongs to <em|class
  <with|mode|math|N> on <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>> iff
  <with|mode|math|v\<equiv\>0> outside a suitable compact subset of this
  region. The functions of this class, which we will be referring to often,
  thus vanish on a boundary strip of <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. This
  aforementioned characterization is then: A field <with|mode|math|u(x,t)>
  which is continuously <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable on
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> is called <em|divergence-free> on
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> iff

  <\equation>
    <value|iintg>u<rsub|i><frac|\<partial\>h|\<partial\>x<rsub|i>>\<mathd\>x
    \<mathd\>t=0
  </equation>

  for any function <with|mode|math|h(x,t)> of class <with|mode|math|N> in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> that is uniquely determined and continuously
  <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable on <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. This fact
  is a consquence of Gauss' Theorem which is applicable because
  <with|mode|math|h\<in\>N> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> and because of the
  fundamental lemma of variational calculus. If we introduce the the scalar
  product of two vector fields <with|mode|math|v(x,t)> and
  <with|mode|math|w(x,t)> on <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> as

  <\equation*>
    <value|iintg>v<rsub|i>w<rsub|i>*\<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t,
  </equation*>

  we can say that ``a field <with|mode|math|u> which is continuously
  <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> is
  divergence-free in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>'' means that
  <with|mode|math|u> is orthogonal in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> to the
  gradient field of any function of class <with|mode|math|N> that is uniquely
  determined and continuously <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>><\footnote>
    <label|fn:formulation-xt>The formulation of these terms in
    <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-space rather than just in
    <with|mode|math|x>-space is advantageous for our problem. Applications of
    Hilbert space theory can be found in the following works:
    <name|O.<nbsp>Nikodym>, Sur un théorème de M.S. Zaremba concernant les
    fonctions harmoniques. J. Math. pur appl., Paris, Sér. IX, <strong|12>
    (1933), 95--109; <name|J.<nbsp>Leray>, Sur le mouvement d'un liquide
    visquex emplissant l'espace. Acta math., Uppsala <strong|63> (1934),
    193--248; <name|H.<nbsp>Weyl>, The method of orthogonal projection in
    potential theory. Duke math J. <strong|7> (1940), 411--444.
  </footnote>.

  The following counterpart of this fact is of interest here: It is necessary
  and sufficient for a field <with|mode|math|h<rprime|'>(x,t)> which is
  continuous in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> (and which has components
  <with|mode|math|h<rprime|'><rsub|i>>) to be the gradient field
  <with|mode|math|h<rprime|'><rsub|i>=\<partial\>h/\<partial\>x<rsub|i>> of
  an in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> uniquely determined and continuously
  <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable function <with|mode|math|h(x,t)> that it
  is orthogonal in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> to any divergence-free field
  of class <with|mode|math|N> that is continuously
  <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.

  Necessity is once more a consequence of the Integral Theorem. The following
  considerations show sufficiency. The consideration of fields of the form
  <with|mode|math|w(x,t)=\<varphi\>(t)\<omega\>(x)> with scalar
  <with|mode|math|\<varphi\>> first shows that we may constrain ourselves to
  the the corresponding claim for <with|mode|math|x>-regions
  <with|mode|math|G>. So, assume

  <\equation*>
    <big|int><rsub|G>w<rsub|i>h<rsub|i><rprime|'>\<mathd\>x=0
  </equation*>

  for any smooth divergence-free field <with|mode|math|w(x)> of class
  <with|mode|math|N> in <with|mode|math|G>. The claim follows if we can show
  that the circulation of the field <with|mode|math|h<rprime|'>>

  <\equation*>
    <big|int><rsub|\<frak-C\>>h<rsub|i><rprime|'>\<mathd\>x<rsub|i>=<big|int><rsub|\<frak-C\>>h<rprime|'><rsub|s>\<mathd\>s
  </equation*>

  vanishes along any closed path <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>> in
  <with|mode|math|G>. It is easy to see that this needs to be shown only for
  continuously curved paths without self-intersections. We will obtain this
  vanishing through a suitable choice of fields <with|mode|math|w>. For any
  given small <with|mode|math|\<varepsilon\>\<gtr\>0>, there is a vector
  field <with|mode|math|w(x)> which is smooth and divergence-free in
  <with|mode|math|G> and which has the following properties:
  <with|mode|math|w> is non-zero only in a closed tube around
  <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>> of thickness
  <with|mode|math|\<less\>\<varepsilon\>>. On any plane tube section that
  cuts <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>> orthogonally, the vector
  <with|mode|math|w> forms an angle <with|mode|math|\<less\>\<varepsilon\>>
  with the normal direction (i.e. the direction of
  <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>> in the section). The sectional flow of
  <with|mode|math|w>, which is independent of the exact shape of the section
  because <with|mode|math|w> is divergence-free, is equal to
  <with|mode|math|1>. This fact suffices to prove the vanishing of the
  circulation along <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>>. We consider such a field
  <with|mode|math|w(x)> that belongs to a given (but sufficiently small)
  <with|mode|math|\<varepsilon\>>. If we let <with|mode|math|\<mathd\>F>
  denote the hypersurface element on these tube sections and if we choose the
  arc length <with|mode|math|s> along <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>> as the
  parameter transverse to the sections, we can write the volume element
  <with|mode|math|\<mathd\>x> in the tube as
  <with|mode|math|\<rho\>(x)\<mathd\>F\<mathd\>s>, where we assume
  <with|mode|math|\<rho\>> to be continuous in a neighborhood of
  <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>> and equal to <with|mode|math|1> on
  <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>>. Then

  <\equation*>
    <big|int>h<rsub|i><rprime|'>w<rsub|i>\<mathd\>x=<big|int><left|[>h<rprime|'><rsub|w>\|w\|\<rho\>*\<mathd\>F<right|]>\<mathd\>s.
  </equation*>

  If we replace the component <with|mode|math|h<rprime|'><rsub|w>> by the
  component <with|mode|math|h<rprime|'><rsub|s>> taken at the intersection of
  <with|mode|math|\<frak-C\>> with the section, <with|mode|math|\|w(x)\|> by
  the component <with|mode|math|w<rsub|s>(x)> taken in a direction normal to
  <with|mode|math|\<mathd\>F> and <with|mode|math|\<rho\>> by 1, then the
  right-hand side integral becomes

  <\equation*>
    <big|int>h<rprime|'><rsub|s><left|[><big|int>w<rsub|s>\<mathd\>F<right|]>\<mathd\>s=<big|int>h<rprime|'><rsub|s>\<mathd\>s,
  </equation*>

  i.e. the circulation. Based upon the aforementioned properties of the field
  <with|mode|math|w>, we can meanwhile easily prove that that the error
  introduced by these replacements goes to zero with
  <with|mode|math|\<varepsilon\>>. Thereby the claim is proven.

  The basic equations of Navier-Stokes for the movement of a homogeneous,
  incompressible liquid are

  <\equation>
    <frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>t>+u<rsub|\<alpha\>><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>=-<frac|\<partial\>p|\<partial\>x<rsub|i>>+\<mu\><frac|\<partial\><rsup|2>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>,
  </equation>

  where <with|mode|math|\<mu\>> is a positive constant, namely the
  <em|kinematic viscosity coefficient> and

  <\equation*>
    div u=0.
  </equation*>

  Let <with|mode|math|u(x,t),p(x,t)> be a solution in an
  <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>
  which we assume to be continuous along with all the occurring derivatives
  <with|mode|math|u<rsub|t>>, <with|mode|math|u<rsub|x>>,
  <with|mode|math|u<rsub|x x>>. We will now introdcue a new time-dependent
  vector field <with|mode|math|a=a(x,t)> which is divergence-free in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. It is assumed to be of class
  <with|mode|math|N> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> and sufficiently smooth:
  <with|mode|math|a> and the derivatives <with|mode|math|a<rsub|t>,a<rsub|x>,a<rsub|x
  x>> should be continuous in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. Otherwise, there
  will be no no requirements on the field <with|mode|math|a>. Because
  <with|mode|math|a\<in\>N> in <with|mode|math|G> and because

  <\equation*>
    u<rsub|\<alpha\>><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>=<frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>u<rsub|\<alpha\>>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>,
  </equation*>

  we have

  <\eqnarray*>
    <tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<value|iintg>a<rsub|i><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>t>\<mathd\>x
    \<mathd\>t>|<cell|=>|<cell|-<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>t>u<rsub|i>*\<mathd\>x
    \<mathd\>t,>>|<row|<cell|<value|iintg>a<rsub|i>u<rsub|\<alpha\>><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>\<mathd\>x
    \<mathd\>t>|<cell|=>|<cell|-<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>u<rsub|\<alpha\>>u<rsub|i>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t,>>|<row|<cell|<value|iintg>a<rsub|i><frac|\<partial\><rsup|2>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t>|<cell|=>|<cell|-<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t=<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\><rsup|2>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t>>>>
  </eqnarray*>

  and since <with|mode|math|div a=0> and <with|mode|math|a\<in\>N>, we have

  <\equation*>
    <value|iintg>a<rsub|i><frac|\<partial\>p|\<partial\>x<rsub|i>> \<mathd\>x
    \<mathd\>t=0.
  </equation*>

  Thereby we find that the field <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> satisfies the
  following condition

  <\equation>
    <label|eq:ns-weak><value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>t>u<rsub|i>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t+<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>u<rsub|\<alpha\>>u<rsub|i>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t+\<mu\><value|iintg><frac|\<partial\><rsup|2>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>u<rsub|i>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t=0
  </equation>

  for any sufficiently smooth field <with|mode|math|a(x,t)> on
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> with the properties

  <\equation>
    <label|eq:a-requirements>div a=0 <with|mode|text|in
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>>,<space|1em>a\<in\>N <with|mode|text|in
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>>.
  </equation>

  In addition, we need to take into account that <with|mode|math|u> is
  divergence-free, i.e.

  <\equation>
    <label|eq:divfree-weak><value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>h|\<partial\>x<rsub|i>>u<rsub|i>
    \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t=0,<space|1em>h\<in\>N <with|mode|text|in>
    <wide|G|^>
  </equation>

  holds for any function of the mentioned class that is sufficiently smooth
  on <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. We have thereby reduced the basic equations
  to the form of equations between linear functional operators of arbitrary
  fields and functions <with|mode|math|a> and <with|mode|math|h>. The
  essential part of this is that the unknown field <with|mode|math|u> on
  which these operators depend occurs without any derivatives.

  We still need to convince ourselves that we may revert from equations
  (<reference|eq:ns-weak>) and (<reference|eq:divfree-weak>) to the
  differential form of the equations if we restrict ourselves to sufficiently
  smooth solution fields <with|mode|math|u> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.
  We already know that under this assumption (<reference|eq:divfree-weak>)
  goes back to <with|mode|math|div u=0> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. For a
  sufficiently smooth <with|mode|math|u>, we may undo all the
  integrations-by-parts. It follows that

  <\equation*>
    <value|iintg>a<rsub|i><left|{><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>t>+u<rsub|\<alpha\>><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>-\<mu\><frac|\<partial\><rsup|2>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>><right|}>\<mathd\>x
    \<mathd\>t
  </equation*>

  must hold for any sufficiently smooth field <with|mode|math|a(x,t)> of the
  form (<reference|eq:a-requirements>). Using the theorem proved above, we
  may conclude that the curly braces must be the partial derivatives of a
  uniquely determined function <with|mode|math|p(x,t)>, i.e. that the
  differential equations of motion must hold in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.
  We see that the above integral form of the equations exactly expresses the
  physical demand that the pressure be unique.

  It is quite natural to build the general mathematical theory on the
  integral form of the equations. But then it is appropriate to rid ourselves
  of the artificial restriction to smooth solution fields <with|mode|math|u>.
  The occurrence of the quadratic forms

  <\equation*>
    <big|int>u<rsub|i>*u<rsub|i> \<mathd\>x,<space|1em><big|int><frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>*<frac|\<partial\>u<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>
    \<mathd\>x
  </equation*>

  in the energy equation leads us to base the problem on a Hilbert space of
  vector fields. It is a methodical advantage that in this broader framework
  the differentiability properties of the solutions <with|mode|math|u> become
  the subject of a problem that can be entirely separated from the problem of
  existence.<\footnote>
    Compare the treatment of quadratic variation and linear differential
    problems by methods of Hilbert spaces in <name|R.<nbsp>Courant> and
    <name|D.<nbsp>Hilbert>, Methoden der mathematischen Physik, Volume 2,
    Berlin 1937, Chapter VII.
  </footnote>

  The common initial value problem of the basic equations of hydrodynamics is
  the following: We need to find the solution <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> in a
  prescribed, moving region <with|mode|math|G(t)>
  (<with|mode|math|t\<geqslant\>0>) of <with|mode|math|x>-space, while
  <with|mode|math|u(0)> in <with|mode|math|G(0)> is prescribed (together with
  a suitably formulated condition of continuous continuation for
  <with|mode|math|t\<rightarrow\>0>) and the boundary values at the boundary
  of <with|mode|math|G(t)>, <with|mode|math|t\<gtr\>0> are also given (with a
  suitably formulated sense of continuation). <name|J.<nbsp>Leray> dedicated
  three sizable works to this problem in the early thirties<\footnote>
    <name|J.<nbsp>Leray>, a) Étude de diverses équations intégrales non
    linéaires et de quelques problèmes que pose l'Hydrodyamique.
    J.Math.pur.appl. Paris, Sér. IX <strong|12> (1933) 1--82; b) Essay sur
    les mouvements plans d'un liquide visqueux que limitent des parois. c)
    loc. cit. in footnote <reference|fn:formulation-xt>.
  </footnote>. These inquiries had already forced Leray to use the methods of
  Hilbert space and the integral interpretation of the equations in three
  dimensions<\footnote>
    A long while before then, <name|C.W.<nbsp>Oseen> had based his well-known
    hydrodynamic inquiries on a form of the basic equations that is free of
    second derivatives. However, he only succeeded in proving existence for
    sufficiently small times. Cf. his work: Hydrodynamik (Leipzig 1927)
  </footnote>. In his works, Leray solved the question of existence for all
  <with|mode|math|t\<gtr\>0> in the following cases, a)
  <with|mode|math|G=\<bbb-R\><rsup|2>> under the added condition of finite
  kinetic energy, b) <with|mode|math|G> is a fixed oval with zero boundary
  values, c) <with|mode|math|G=\<bbb-R\><rsup|3>> under the added condition
  of finite kinetic energy. The remarkable analysis that Leray dedicates to
  the question of differentiability point to a strange difference between the
  dimensions <with|mode|math|n=2> and <with|mode|math|n\<gtr\>2>. While, at
  least if in the first case <with|mode|math|G> is the entire plane, the
  proof of infinite differentiability is successful, the proof methods that
  one should view as natural fail for <with|mode|math|n\<geqslant\>3>. Even
  for arbitrary smoothness of all prescribed data, the proof of smoothness of
  the solution did not work out. The other strange thing is the failure of
  the uniqeness proff in three dimensions. These questions are still not
  answered satisfactorily. It is hard to believe that the initial value
  problem of viscous liquids for <with|mode|math|n=3> should have more than
  one solution, and more attention should be paid to the settling of the
  uniqueness question. However, newer research indicates that for nonlinear
  partial differential problems the number of independent variables has
  significant influence on the local properties of solutions.

  In the present work, which is also dedicated to the initial value problem
  and in which we assume the integral view of the equations as their primary
  form, we will leave aside the questions of differentiability and
  uniqueness. We hope to come back to these things as well as to the proof of
  the energy equation (which is easy in our context) in later memoranda. The
  main point of this work is that the construction of approximate solutions
  that takes such broad space in Leray's work is replaced here by simpler
  process, which may also be applied to a much broader classes of partial
  differential problems. We also hope to come back to this issue later. This
  method enables the solution of the initial value problem for all
  <with|mode|math|t\<gtr\>0> in substantial generality, however in this first
  memorandum what matters to us is more the exposition of the basic idea of
  the method rather than the generality of the results. We will restrain
  ourselves to the case that the <with|mode|math|x>-region <with|mode|math|G>
  is fixed in time, but otherwise completely arbitrary, and where
  <with|mode|math|u> has vanishing boundary values. The boundary condition
  will be defined in terms of Hilbert space--broad enough to guarantee
  solvability, and narrow enough to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution,
  at least in two dimensions<\footnote>
    <label|fn:bc-finite-kinetic>If <with|mode|math|G> is the entire
    <with|mode|math|x>-space, the boundary condition thus phrased becomes the
    condition of finite kinetic energy and finite dissipation integral.

    The phrasing of the boundary condition is suggested by the work of
    <name|R.<nbsp>Courant> and <name|D.<nbsp>Hilbert>, Methoden der
    mathematischen Physik, Vol. 2, Berlin 1937, Chap. VII, 1, 3rd section.

  not play any role.

  <section|The Function Class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>>. Solutions of
  Class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>>.>

  We will take the class <with|mode|math|H> with respect to an
  <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> to
  mean the class of all real, measurable functions <with|mode|math|f(x,t)>
  defined on this region with finite norm

  <\equation*>
    <value|iintg>f<rsup|2> \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t.
  </equation*>

  <with|mode|math|H> is a real Hilbert space. Terms such as weak and strong
  convergence in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> will be understood in the
  following with respect to the norm. We remind that a sequence of functions
  <with|mode|math|f\<in\>H> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> converges weakly
  if first, the norms of all <with|mode|math|f> remain below a fixed value
  and second, if

  </equation*>

  holds for any fixed function <with|mode|math|g\<in\>H> in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. While maintaining the first condition, the
  second one may be weakened to the effect that the sequence of numbers

  <\equation*>
    <value|iintg>f*g \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t
  </equation*>

  converges for any fixed <with|mode|math|g> in a set that is strongly dense
  in <with|mode|math|H>. Then, there exists one, and essentially only one
  weak limit function <with|mode|math|f<rsup|\<ast\>>> in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. Besides these terms, for which we have assumed
  an <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region, we will have to use the
  same terms for a purely spatial <with|mode|math|x>-region
  <with|mode|math|G>. In this case, we will base our considerations on the
  norm

  <\equation*>
    <big|int><rsub|G>f<rsup|2>\<mathd\>x.
  </equation*>

  We remind the reader of the weak compactness of a sequence of functions
  with uniformly bounded norms (F.<nbsp>Riesz's Theorem). The following
  criterion for strong convergence, which was also used extensively by Leray,
  will also be necessary here. For a sequence of functions that converges
  weakly in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> to a limit function
  <with|mode|math|f<rsup|\<ast\>>>, we have

  <\equation*>
    <wide|<op|lim>|\<bar\>><value|iintg>f<rsup|2>\<mathd\>x*\<mathd\>t\<geqslant\><value|iintg>(f<rsup|\<ast\>>)<rsup|2>\<mathd\>x
    \<mathd\>t,
  </equation*>

  where equality holds if and only if <with|mode|math|f\<rightarrow\>f<rsup|\<ast\>>>
  in the strong sense. All these things transfer to vector fields
  <with|mode|math|u>, <with|mode|math|v> on <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> if we
  use the scalar product

  <\equation*>
    <value|iintg>u<rsub|i>v<rsub|i> \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t
  </equation*>

  and the corresponding norm.

  <\lemma>
    If the vector fields <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> converge weakly in
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> to a limit field
    <with|mode|math|u<rsup|\<ast\>>(x,t)>, then

    <\equation*>
      <wide|lim|\<bar\>><value|iintg>u<rsub|i>u<rsub|i> \<mathd\>x

      \<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t.
    </equation*>

    Equality holds if and only if the convergence in
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> is strong.
  </lemma>

  Like Leray, we need the term of a generalized (purely spatial)
  <with|mode|math|x>-derivative of functions <with|mode|math|f(x,t)> and
  fields <with|mode|math|u(x,t)>.

  <\definition>
    <label|def:hprime>An <with|mode|math|f(x,t)> defined on an
    <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>
    is defined to belong to the class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> if and
    only if it has the following properties: <with|mode|math|f> belongs to
    <with|mode|math|H> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. There exist
    <with|mode|math|n> functions <with|mode|math|f<rsub|<rprime|'>i>>
    belonging to <with|mode|math|H> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> such that
    the relations

    <\equation>
      <label|eq:def-weak-deriv><value|iintg>h*f<rsub|<rprime|'>i> \<mathd\>x
      \<mathd\>t=-<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>h|\<partial\>x<rsub|i>>*f*\<mathd\>x
      \<mathd\>t<space|1em>(h\<in\>N <with|mode|text|in> <wide|G|^>)
    </equation>

    are satisfied for any function <with|mode|math|h(x,t)> which is
    continuous in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> along with its derivatives and
    which belongs to class <with|mode|math|N>, and for any
    <with|mode|math|i=1,2,\<ldots\>,n>.
  </definition>

  The class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> obviously contains any
  <with|mode|math|f(x,t)> that is continuously
  <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> such that
  <with|mode|math|f> and all <with|mode|math|\<partial\>f/\<partial\>x<rsub|i>>
  belong to <with|mode|math|H> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. For such an
  <with|mode|math|f>, we have <with|mode|math|\<partial\>f/\<partial\>x<rsub|i>=f<rsub|<rprime|'>i>>.
  This follows from the integral theorem and the demand that
  <with|mode|math|h> must belong to <with|mode|math|N>, i.e. that
  <with|mode|math|h> vanishes outside a certain compact subset of
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. Obviously, generalized
  <with|mode|math|x>-derivatives <with|mode|math|f<rsub|<rprime|'>i>> in
  <with|mode|math|G> are uniquely determined except for the values on an
  <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-zero set in the case of
  <with|mode|math|f\<in\>H<rprime|'>> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.

  <\lemma>
    <label|lem:weak-deriv-weak-conv>If a sequence of functions of class

    <\equation*>

    are uniformly bounded, then <with|mode|math|f<rsup|\<ast\>>> also belongs
    to <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> and every
    <with|mode|math|x>-derivatives <with|mode|math|f<rsub|<rprime|'>i>>
    converges weakly to the corresponding <with|mode|math|x>-derivative
    <with|mode|math|f<rsup|\<ast\>><rsub|<rprime|'>i>>.
  </lemma>

  <\proof>
    Every <with|mode|math|f> satisfies (<reference|eq:def-weak-deriv>), where
    <with|mode|math|h> is an arbitrary function that is admissible there. The
    right hand sides converge to

    <\equation*>
      -<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>h|\<partial\>x<rsub|i>>*f*<rsup|\<ast\>>\<mathd\>x
      \<mathd\>t.
    </equation*>

    For a fixed <with|mode|math|h> and <with|mode|math|i>, the left hand
    sides converge along the sequence of the <with|mode|math|f>'s. The
    admissible functions <with|mode|math|h> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>
    lie strongly dense in the Hilbert space <with|mode|math|H>.Thus, for any
    fixed <with|mode|math|i> the sequence of the
    <with|mode|math|f<rsub|<rprime|'>i>> is weakly convergent. If we let
    <with|mode|math|f<rsup|\<ast\>><rsub|i>> denote the limit function, then
    from (<reference|eq:def-weak-deriv>), we conclude that

    <\equation*>
      <value|iintg>h*f<rsup|\<ast\>><rsub|i> \<mathd\>x
      \<mathd\>t=-<value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>h|\<partial\>x<rsub|i>>*f*<rsup|\<ast\>>\<mathd\>x
      \<mathd\>t
    </equation*>

    holds for any admissible <with|mode|math|h> and <with|mode|math|i>. By
    Definition <reference|def:hprime>, <with|mode|math|f<rsup|\<ast\>>>
    belongs to <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>,
    and because of uniquness of the <with|mode|math|x>-derivative, we have
    <with|mode|math|f<rsup|\<ast\>><rsub|i>=f<rsup|\<ast\>><rsub|<rprime|'>i>>.
  </proof>

  A field is said to be of class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> if this is the case for all components.

  In the above integral form of the basic equations of hydrodynamics, there
  are no derivatives on <with|mode|math|u>. It is however practical to make a
  weak differentiability assumption like membership in the class
  <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> on the solutions <with|mode|math|u>. We may
  then write for the friction term in (<reference|eq:ns-weak>)

  <\equation>
    \<mu\><value|iintg><frac|\<partial\><rsup|2>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>u<rsub|i><value|dxdt>=-\<mu\><value|iintg><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>u<rsub|i,\<beta\>><value|dxdt>.
  </equation>

  <\definition>
    <label|def:ns-weak-solution>A field <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> is called a
    solution of class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> of the basic equations of
    hydrodynamics in the <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> if it satisfies the following conditions:

    <\enumerate-alpha>
      <item><with|mode|math|u\<in\>H<rprime|'>> in
      <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.

      <item>Vanishing divergence; any function <with|mode|math|h> which is of

      (<reference|eq:divfree-weak>).

      <item>Equations of motion; any field <with|mode|math|a(x,t)> that is of
      class <with|mode|math|N> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>,
      divergence-free and continuous along with its derivatives
      <with|mode|math|a<rsub|t>>, <with|mode|math|a<rsub|x>>,
      <with|mode|math|a<rsub|x x>> satisfies the relation
      (<reference|eq:ns-weak>).
    </enumerate-alpha>
  </definition>

  Observe that under the condition a) the term in the basic equations
  (<reference|eq:ns-weak>) which is nonlinear in <with|mode|math|u> is a
  valid Lebesgue integral for any admissible field <with|mode|math|a>. That
  is already the case if <with|mode|math|u\<in\>H> in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.

  Because of a) the condition of incompressibility b) is equivalent with

  <\equation*>
    div u\<equiv\>u<rsub|i,i>=0
  </equation*>

  for a.e. <with|mode|math|(x,t)\<in\><wide|G|^>>.

  We will consider all integrands in the basic equations <eqref|eq:ns-weak>
  outside of <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> defined to zero. The integrals can
  then be extended over all <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-space. With
  this convention, the following theorem, which we would like to prove here
  even though it is not needed in this paper, holds:

  <\theorem>
    A solution of class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> satisfies the equation

    </equation>

    for a.e. value of <with|mode|math|\<tau\>>.
  </theorem>

  <\proof>
    Consider that along with <with|mode|math|a(x,t)>,
    <with|mode|math|h(t)a(x,t)> is also an admissible field if
    <with|mode|math|h(t)> is an arbitrary continuously differentiable
    function for all <with|mode|math|t>. If we replace <with|mode|math|a> by
    <with|mode|math|h a> in equation <eqref|eq:ns-weak>, which we write
    abbreviated as

    <\equation*>
      <big|int><big|int>K[a,u]\<mathd\>x \<mathd\>t=<big|int><rsub|-\<infty\>><rsup|\<infty\>><left|{><big|int><rsub|t=\<tau\>>K[a,u]<right|}>\<mathd\>\<tau\>=0,
    </equation*>

    it follows that the equation

    <\equation>
      <label|eq:tau-a-ha><big|int><rsub|-\<infty\>><rsup|\<infty\>>h(\<tau\>)<left|{><big|int><rsub|t=\<tau\>>K
      \<mathd\>x<right|}>\<mathd\>\<tau\>+<big|int><rsub|-\<infty\>><rsup|\<infty\>>h<rprime|'>(\<tau\>)<left|{><big|int><rsub|t=\<tau\>>a<rsub|i>u<rsub|i>\<mathd\>x<right|}>\<mathd\>\<tau\>=0
    </equation>

    is also satisfied. The terms in curly braces are Lebesgue-integrable
    functions of <with|mode|math|\<tau\>> on
    <with|mode|math|-\<infty\>\<less\>\<tau\>\<less\>\<infty\>> that vanish
    for all large <with|mode|math|\|\<tau\>\|>. The validity of
    <eqref|eq:tau-a-ha> for abritray <with|mode|math|h(\<tau\>)> with
    continuous <with|mode|math|h<rprime|'>(\<tau\>)> is equivalent with the
    fact that

    <\equation*>
      <big|int><rsub|t=\<tau\>>a<rsub|i>u<rsub|i>\<mathd\>x=<big|int><rsub|-\<infty\>><rsup|t><left|{><big|int><rsub|t
      <with|mode|text|fixed>>K \<mathd\>x<right|}>\<mathd\>t=<big|int><big|int><rsub|t\<less\>\<tau\>>K<value|dxdt>
    </equation*>

    for a.e. <with|mode|math|\<tau\>>.
  </proof>

  In <eqref|eq:up-to-tau>, the left hand side is defined for just a.e.
  <with|mode|math|\<tau\>>, while the right hand side is an
  <with|color|red|absolutely continuous> (totalstetig) function of
  <with|mode|math|\<tau\>>. In fact, one can prove: A solution of lcass
  <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> can be changed
  on an <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-zero set such that the new
  <with|mode|math|u> satisfies <eqref|eq:up-to-tau> without exception, i.e.
  for any admissible <with|mode|math|a> and any <with|mode|math|\<tau\>>. But
  we will not elaborate further on this here.

  <section|The Boundary Condition of Vanishing. The Initial Value Problem.>

  The cross sections <with|mode|math|t=const> of the
  <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>
  are <with|mode|math|x>-region <with|mode|math|G(t)>. By using just terms of
  Hilbert space, we need to get as close as possible to the boundary
  condition of vanishing of a function <with|mode|math|g(x,t)> and a field
  <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> for all <with|mode|math|t> on the boundary of
  <with|mode|math|G(t)>. This can be achieved by obtaining the function
  <with|mode|math|g> from function of class <with|mode|math|N> in
  <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> by means of a limit process. In doing so, it is
  necessary to use sufficiently effective bounds on the spatial
  <with|mode|math|x>-derivatives (but not on the
  <with|mode|math|t>-derivatives) of the approximating functions, so that the
  ``vanishing'' remains intact along the boundaries of the
  <with|mode|math|x>-regions <with|mode|math|G(t)>. We express the boundary
  condition by membership in the following function class
  <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)>.

  <\definition>
    <label|def:bc-vanishing>A function <with|mode|math|g(x,t)> is said to be
    of class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>
    if it is a weak limit function in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> of a
    sequence of functions <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>(x,t)>, which belong to
    <with|mode|math|N> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> and are continuous
    along with their <with|mode|math|x>-derivatives und for which the
    expressions

    <\equation>
      <label|eq:bc-def-h1-norm><value|iintg>\<gamma\><rsup|2><value|dxdt>+<value|iintg>\<gamma\><rsub|<rprime|'>i>\<gamma\><rsub|<rprime|'>i><value|dxdt>
    </equation>

    are uniformly bounded.<\footnote>
      Cf. <name|Courant-Hilbert>, l.c. footnote
      <reference|fn:bc-finite-kinetic>, p. 218. The definition of the
      boundary condition of vanishing given there is only seemingly stronger
      than ours. By S. Saks' Theorem the sequence of arithmetic means of a
      weakly convergent sequence has a strongly convergent subsequence. It
      follows from this theorem and from Lemma
      <reference|lem:weak-deriv-weak-conv> that for any <with|mode|math|g> in
      <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)>, there exists a sequence of functions
      <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> of the above-mentioned kind such that

      <\equation*>
        \<gamma\>\<rightarrow\>g,<space|1em>\<gamma\><rsub|<rprime|'>i>\<rightarrow\>g<rsub|<rprime|'>i>
      </equation*>

      holds inthe strong sense.
    </footnote>
  </definition>

  It follows from Lemma <reference|lem:weak-deriv-weak-conv> that for a given
  <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region <with|mode|math|G> the class
  <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)> is contained in the class
  <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>>.

  <\lemma>
    Let <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> by a cylinder set
    <with|mode|math|x\<subset\>G>, <with|mode|math|0\<less\>t\<less\>T>. Let
    <with|mode|math|g(x,t)> be the weak limit in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>
    of a sequence of functions <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>(x,t)> continuously
    <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> that are
    of the following kind: For each <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> there is a
    compact subset of the <with|mode|math|x>-region <with|mode|math|G> such
    that <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> vanishes for <with|mode|math|x> outside
    that set; \ also let the integrals <eqref|eq:bc-def-h1-norm> be uniformly
    bounded. Then <with|mode|math|g> belongs to
    <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.<\footnote>
      If <with|mode|math|G> is all <with|mode|math|x>-space, the class
      <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>*(N)> coincides with the class
      <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>>. In this case the admissible
      <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> are strongly dense in the function space
      <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> in the sense of the norm
      <eqref|eq:bc-def-h1-norm>.
    </footnote>
  </lemma>

  <\proof>
    Observe the difference between the class of the
    <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> admissible in this lemma and the narrower
    class of the <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> of Definition
    <reference|def:bc-vanishing>. Membership of <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> in
    <with|mode|math|N> in the <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-region
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> in the present case requires that
    <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> vanishes sufficiently close to
    <with|mode|math|t=0> and <with|mode|math|t=T>. But since only
    <with|mode|math|x>-derivatives occur in <eqref|eq:bc-def-h1-norm>, this
    difference is inconsequential. If we replace the present
    <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> by functions
    <with|mode|math|\<varphi\>(t)\<gamma\>(x,t)>, where
    <with|mode|math|\<varphi\>> is continuous in

    and otherwise <with|mode|math|0\<less\>\<varphi\>\<less\>1>
    (<with|mode|math|\<varepsilon\>\<rightarrow\>0>), then Definition
    <reference|def:bc-vanishing> applies to the new
    <with|mode|math|<wide|\<gamma\>|~>=\<varphi\>\<gamma\>>. Thus
    <with|mode|math|g> belongs to <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)>.
  </proof>

  <\lemma>
    The relations

    <\equation*>
      <value|iintg>g<rsub|<rprime|'>i><value|dxdt>=-<value|iintg>g*f<rsub|<rprime|'>i><value|dxdt><space|1em>(i=1,2,\<ldots\>,n)

    are satisfied by any f of class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> in
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> and any <with|mode|math|g> of class
    <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.
  </lemma>

  <\proof>
    By Definition <reference|def:hprime>, the relations hold for any
    specified <with|mode|math|f> and for any <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> that
    is continuously <with|mode|math|x>-differentiable and of class
    <with|mode|math|N> in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. By Definition
    <reference|def:bc-vanishing>, <with|mode|math|g> is a weak limit of a
    sequence of such <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> with uniforml bounded
    integrals <eqref|eq:bc-def-h1-norm> By Lemma
    <reference|lem:weak-deriv-weak-conv>, besides
    <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>\<rightarrow\>g>, we also have
    <with|mode|math|\<gamma\><rsub|<rprime|'>i>\<rightarrow\>g<rsub|<rprime|'>i>>
    weakly in <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>. The relations that hold for
    <with|mode|math|f>, <with|mode|math|\<gamma\>> thus also hold for
    <with|mode|math|f>, <with|mode|math|g>.
  </proof>

  To facilitate a more convenient phrasing of the initial condition, we also
  introduc the class <with|mode|math|H(N)>. In doing so, we restrict
  ourselves to <with|mode|math|x>-space and field <with|mode|math|u(x)> that
  are defined in an <with|mode|math|x>-region <with|mode|math|G>. If we only
  consider functions <with|mode|math|f(x)> that belong to both the classes
  <with|mode|math|H> and <with|mode|math|N>, then it is clear that the strong
  closure of these sets of functions is identical to <with|mode|math|H>. The
  same is true of vector fields in <with|mode|math|G>. However, a difference
  arises if we restrict ourselves to divergence-free fields in
  <with|mode|math|G>.

  <\definition>
    A divergence-free field in <with|mode|math|G> of class <with|mode|math|H>
    is said to be of class <with|mode|math|H(N)> if it is a weak limit field
    of fields that belong to <with|mode|math|N> in <with|mode|math|G>, that
    are twice continuously differentiable and that are
    divergence-free.<\footnote>
      By Saks' Theorem, it is then also the strong limit field of just these
      fields.
    </footnote>
  </definition>

  One easily proves the following: If the field <with|mode|math|u(x)> is
  divergence-free and of class <with|mode|math|H(N)> and if the function
  <with|mode|math|\<varphi\>(x)> is of class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>>,
  then\ 

  <\equation*>
    <big|int><rsub|G>u<rsub|i>\<varphi\><rsub|<rprime|'>i> \<mathd\>x=0.
  </equation*>

  Membership of a divergence-free field in <with|mode|math|H(N)> obviously
  replaces the boundary condition of vanishing on the normal component.

  We may now state the existence theorem for the hydrodynamic initial value
  problem.

  <\theorem>
    <em|(Existence theorem)>Let <with|mode|math|G> be an arbitrary region of
    <with|mode|math|x>-space. Let the field <with|mode|math|U(x)> be
    divergence-free in <with|mode|math|G> and of class <with|mode|math|H(N)>,
    but otherwise arbitrary. Then there is a field <with|mode|math|u(x,t)>
    defined for all <with|mode|math|t\<gtr\>0> in <with|mode|math|G> with the
    following properties:

    <\enumerate-Alpha>
      <item>In any <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-cylinder region
      <with|mode|math|x\<subset\>G>, <with|mode|math|0\<less\>t\<less\>T>,
      <with|mode|math|u> is a solution of class <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>>
      of the basic equations of hydrodynamics (cf. Definition
      <reference|def:ns-weak-solution>).

      <item>``Vanishing of the boundary values'' for
      <with|mode|math|t\<gtr\>0>: In any of the above-mentioned cylinder
      regions, <with|mode|math|u> belongs to <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>(N)>.

      <item>Initial condition: For <with|mode|math|t\<rightarrow\>0>,
      <with|mode|math|u(x,t)\<rightarrow\>U(x)> converges strongly in
      <with|mode|math|G>.
    </enumerate-Alpha>
  </theorem>

  <section|Simplification of the Problem. The Approximation Procedure.>

  For the construction of the solution of the initial value problem for an
  <with|mode|math|x>-region <with|mode|math|G> constant in time, we start
  with the equation

  <\equation>
    <label|eq:ns-tau-to-tauprime><big|int><rsub|G>a<rsub|i>u<rsub|i>
    \<mathd\>x\|<rsub|t=\<tau\><rprime|'>>-<big|int><rsub|G>a<rsub|i>u<rsub|i>\|<rsub|t=\<tau\>>=<big|int><rsub|\<tau\>><rsup|\<tau\><rprime|'>><big|int><rsub|G><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>t>u<rsub|i><value|dxdt>+<big|int><rsub|\<tau\>><rsup|\<tau\><rprime|'>><big|int><rsub|G><frac|\<partial\>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<alpha\>>>u<rsub|\<alpha\>>u<rsub|i><value|dxdt>+\<mu\><big|int><rsub|\<tau\>><rsup|\<tau\><rprime|'>><big|int><rsub|G><frac|\<partial\><rsup|2>a<rsub|i>|\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>\<partial\>x<rsub|\<beta\>>>u<value|dxdt>.
  </equation>

  <\lemma>
    Let the field <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> be defined in <with|mode|math|G>
    for all <with|mode|math|t\<gtr\>0> and let it belong to class
    <with|mode|math|H> in any cylinder section <with|mode|math|x\<subset\>G>,
    <with|mode|math|0\<less\>t\<less\>T> of
    <with|mode|math|x>-<with|mode|math|t>-space. Let it satisfy Equation
    <eqref|eq:ns-tau-to-tauprime> for all
    <with|mode|math|\<tau\><rprime|'>\<gtr\>\<tau\>\<gtr\>0> and for any
    field <with|mode|math|a> such that: <with|mode|math|a=a(x)> is twice
    continuously differentiable and

    <\equation>
      <label|eq:cylinder-admissible-testfield>a=a(x),<space|1em>div a=0
      <with|mode|text|in> G,<space|1em>a\<in\>N <with|mode|text|in> G,
    </equation>

    i.e. <with|mode|math|a(x)> vansishes outside a suitable compact subset of
    <with|mode|math|G>.

    Then <with|mode|math|u> satisfies the basic equation <eqref|eq:ns-weak>
    for the half cylinder <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>:
    <with|mode|math|x\<subset\>G>, <with|mode|math|t\<gtr\>0> and for any
    field admissible there (cf. condition c) in the definition
    <reference|def:ns-weak-solution> of a weak solution).
  </lemma>

  <\proof>
    If we write <eqref|eq:ns-tau-to-tauprime> in the abbreviated form

    <\equation*>
      f(\<tau\><rprime|'>)-f(\<tau\>)=<big|int><rsub|\<tau\>><rsup|\<tau\><rprime|'>>g(t),
    </equation*>

    we see that the equation

    <\equation*>
      <big|int><rsub|0><rsup|\<infty\>>\<varphi\><rprime|'>(t)f(t)
      \<mathd\>t+<big|int><rsub|0><rsup|\<infty\>>\<varphi\>(t)g(t)
      \<mathd\>t=0
    </equation*>

    must be satisfied for any <with|mode|math|\<varphi\>> that is
    continuously differentiable in <with|mode|math|(0,\<infty\>>) and which
    vanishes for all sufficiently small and large <with|mode|math|t>. If we
    once more write the equation out in full, we recognize that Equation
    <eqref|eq:ns-weak> is satisfied in said half cylinder by any filed
    <with|mode|math|a=\<varphi\>(t)a(x)>, where <with|mode|math|a(x)> is an
    arbitrary one of the fields permitted above
    <eqref|eq:cylinder-admissible-testfield> and
    <with|mode|math|\<varphi\>(t)> is an arbitrary one of the functions
    permitted above. But now any <with|mode|math|a(x,t)> permitted by
    condition c) in the definition <reference|def:ns-weak-solution> of a
    solution may be approximated in the half cylinder
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> by sums of fields of such special shape that
    in the basic equation <eqref|eq:ns-weak> integration and limit may be
    interchanged. E.g. one could always arrange that the convergnece of the
    fields and their derivatives up to a prescribed order in
    <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>> is uniform and that the approximating fields
    all vanish outside a fixed compact subset of <with|mode|math|<wide|G|^>>.

    It is thereby clear that a field <with|mode|math|u(x,t)> which satisfies
    <eqref|eq:ns-tau-to-tauprime> to the extent specified in the lemma, and
    which is further divergence-free and which belongs to class
    <with|mode|math|H<rprime|'>> in any cylinder section satisfies the full
    scope of the definition <reference|def:ns-weak-solution> of a solution on
    any cylinder section.
  </proof>

  The following fact yields an even better basic equation:

  <\lemma>
    There is a sequence of twice continuously differentiable and linearly
    independent fields in <with|mode|math|G> in the field space
    <eqref|eq:cylinder-admissible-testfield>

    <\equation*>
      a=a<rsup|\<nu\>>(x),<space|1em>div a<rsup|\<nu\>>=0 <with|mode|text|in>
      G,<space|1em>a<rsup|\<nu\>>\<in\>N <with|mode|text|in> G
    </equation*>

    with the following property: An arbitrary twice continuously
    differentiable field in <with|mode|math|G> of the form
    <eqref|eq:cylinder-admissible-testfield> is the uniform limit field in
    <with|mode|math|G> of a sequence of finite linear combinations of the
    field <with|mode|math|a<rsup|\<nu\>>(x)>, with uniform convergence of
    even the derivatives up to second order in <with|mode|math|G>. For a
    given <with|mode|math|a(x)>, only such linear combinations occur in this
    approximation that have the value zero outside a certain compact subset
    of <with|mode|math|G> which only depends on <with|mode|math|a>.
